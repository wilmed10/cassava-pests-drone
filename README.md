# **Drone System for Pest Detection in Cassava Crops with Custom TensorFlow Lite Model**

This project was designed to perform early detection of pests (gall flies, weeds, and mosaic) in cassava crops with the help of a drone. The development of the project is detailed below:

1. Drone assembly.
2. Training of the custom model with TensorFlow Lite.
3. System configuration on Raspberry Pi 4.

## Drone Assembly

![drone](/assets/dron.jpg)

The drone used for this purpose is 10 inches, which allows it to carry the Raspberry Pi and the battery. The components needed to assemble the drone are as follows:

- Frame 450
- 10-inch propellers
- APM 2.8
- M8N GPS module
- 40 amp ESC
- D2030 1000kv brushless motor
- Flysky FS-i6X
- FS-IA6B receiver
- 3S 5000mAh battery
- BEC

The connections for the drone assembly are as follows:

## **Custom Model Training with TensorFlow Lite (EfficientDet Lite0)**

To train the model with TensorFlow Lite, the EfficientDet Lite0 model was chosen. Follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment or install `Python 3.9.0` on your PC from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/).
2. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```
pip install â€“upgrade pip
pip install numpy==1.23.4
pip install tensorflow==2.8.0
pip install tflite-model-maker
```

With this we have enough to run `./train/efficientdet_lite0_train.py` once we have the dataset ready.
To do this, it is necessary to tag the images, either with makesense.ai or roboflow.com, and finally export the dataset in ***PASCAL VOC*** format so that the folder is structured as follows:

```
.
|-	train
|	|- img1.jpg
|	|- img1.xml
|-	validate
|	|- img5.jpg
|	|- img5.xml
```

With the prerequisites installed and the dataset ready we can now run the script that generates the model as `model.tflite`

```
python efficientdet_lite0_train.py
```

## **System configuration on Raspberry pi 4**

The detection system is configured to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 board with Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit), to continue with the system configuration, we follow the following steps:

```
# for update and auto-upgrade all packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Camera configuration

```
# Arducam 64MP HawkEye prerequisites
wget -O install_pivariety_pkgs.sh https://github.com/ArduCAM/Arducam-Pivariety-V4L2-Driver/releases/download/install_script/install_pivariety_pkgs.sh
chmod +x install_pivariety_pkgs.sh
./install_pivariety_pkgs.sh -p libcamera_dev
./install_pivariety_pkgs.sh -p libcamera_apps
```

Modify .Config file

```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt 
#Find the line: [all], add the following item under it:
dtoverlay=arducam-64mp
#Save and reboot.
```

### Install `gpsd`

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gpsd gpsd-clients python3-gps -y
# config gpsd
sudo nano /etc/default/gpsd
# modify the lines:
# Paths to GPS devices
DEVICES="/dev/ttyUSB0"  # Change to your GPS port

#reboot and enable gpsd
sudo systemctl stop gpsd.socket
sudo systemctl disable gpsd.socket
sudo systemctl enable gpsd
sudo systemctl start gpsd
```

### Install Tflite

```
#clone repository
git clone https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi.git
cd TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi

#install dependency
chmod +x get_pi_requirements.sh
./get_pi_requirements.sh
```

### Drone system

To run the drone's operating code, you need to paste the following scripts into the cloned folder on the Raspberry Pi board:
*./system/drone.py
*./system/gpsDrone.py
Additionally, you need to paste the pre-trained model (.tflite) into the `Sample_TFLite_model` folder

```
# to run the drone code, go to the tflite folder and run the command
python3 drone.py
```

### Communication System

Once we execute the operation script on the Raspberry Pi, it is necessary to compile and upload the code `./system/communication.ino` to the ESP8266 or ESP32 board to carry out communication between the drone and the remote user.
